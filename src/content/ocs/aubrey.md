## bio

Loves to be around people, loves to be loved and included. "Good vibes only" type, tries hard to focus on the positives, generally appears to be in a good mood. Actually struggles a lot with anxiety and depression, to the point of self-harming and frequently wanting to die during middle and high school, but represses it and tries his best to hide it from others; doesn't actually start seeking out help for it until college. Poster-child millenial. Raised by the internet, but has perhaps unexpectedly strong social skills online and off. Makes friends easily and loves to meet new people and get to know them; believes that everyone has a story. Also loves trying new things, or just newness in general. Lives for the present. 

Desperately craves validation and attention. Fairly vain; has a bad habit of believing people like him for his looks and fearing he'll be abandoned if he loses that. Seeks out experiences he can lose himself in. Afraid of getting older.

Identifies as a guy for sure but also identifies as a femme and does experience some dysphoria over being a femme with a DMAB body. Extremely sensitive/dysphoric about body hair and shaves meticulously. Figured out gender stuff through a lot of messy experimentation during middle school, and his confidence about being gender non-conforming was really important in giving Soo Jin the confidence to come out as non-binary. In some timelines, he eventually does decide to start taking estrogen somewhere in his twenties or early thirties, but still identifies as a man.

Loves cute things. Writes fanfic. Has lots of feelings about music and webcomics. Uncommonly, both chronically online *and* a 365 party boy.

### age 15 vs. age 25
**age 15:** dumb teen and silly scene kid, ~ kawaii uwu ~, nothing matters and he's indestructible, happy go lucky with an edge of chuuni sarcasm, vain, bright bright colors, 4chan and fanfiction.net

**age 25:** starting to take life a little more seriously (but not too seriously), subtler makeup, Cool Fashion, still a giant dork but covers it up more, gin instead of cheap rum, still lives for cute shit, better at filling his life with good people
