        <h2>basic info</h2>
        <p><em>site first published 2/24/25!</em></p>
        <p>
            well, as you can tell, this site is still just a little baby... lmao
        </p>
        <p>
            i'm not fully sure what i'm planning to do with this site! the
            impetus to make it came from 3 things: i wanted a very low-key new
            blog to post random thoughts, i wanted to learn the astro framework
            (and it just so happened that the starter tutorial was about making
            a blog!), and i really admire neocities and its culture and wanted
            to be part of that. so a big thing i'm hoping to host here is like,
            some tutorials or other kinds of resources for other neocities
            creators to learn from or use! especially since i do have a bit more
            experience with web development than some other folks here, i really
            want to share what i know and help empower people to make the sites
            of their dreams!
        </p>
        <p>
            other things i post here will probably be a bit more self indulgent
            haha... like maybe some stuff about my OCs, lists of my favorite
            things, whatever... but i know that's what people who like the indie
            web are interested in anyway, so i'll try not to feel self-conscious
            about it lol.
        </p>
        <p>
            the funny thing is, i was enchanted with neocities when i first
            discovered it 5 years ago and i went and made this account right
            away, but... i didn't actually get around to putting any <em
                >content</em
            > on my site or actually doing anything with it for those 5 years. lmao.
            so i guess i am finally fixing that long standing silliness.
        </p>
        <p>
            fun fact: i had a legit Geocities back in the day and YES i DID use
            a table layout with a drawing of my OC in the sidebar. still hoping
            that someday i'll find the code/assets from that old site buried on
            some hard drive and be able to resurrect it.
        </p>
        <p>
            ...anyway, if you get any kind of enjoiyment from this site, that
            would make me really happy! and if you have any thoughts about the
            site or anything i mention on it, feel free to <a href="/aboutme#contact">get in touch</a>!
