        </ul>
        <h3 class="margin-top-1rem" id="jasper">jasper</h3>
        <p>as mentioned above, i am plural! that means there is actually more than one person who lives in my brain: there's vance, who is kind of the "main" consciousness that's always present, and then there's jasper, who just kinda fades in and out of consciousness at different times. if this doesn't make sense or you wanna learn more about what plurality is, check out this fantastic <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M34kR9JWWqc" rel="noopener noreferrer">video from body et al.</a> or <a href="https://dragonsroost.neocities.org/pluralstuff" rel="noopener noreferrer">dragon's roost</a>!</p>
        <p>in general, the content on this site is written mainly by vance, and when we say "i" we are usually referring <em>mainly</em> to vance... but at the same time, the name "vance" also kind of refers to us as a collective? (ps, we prefer the term "collective" rather than "system" to refer to "the unit consisting of vance and jasper together"--and no we don't have a separate collective name) it's kind of hard to explain... but in short, you don't really need to do anything or regard us/me any differently as a result of us being plural. we just wanted to mention jas here because, well, ze <em>is</em> part of the "me" making this site, and there might even eventually be some content written specifically by jas. so, with that in mind, here is jasper's self introduction:</p>
        <blockquote class="jasper">
            <p>hey, it is jasper.... uh. i was thinking earlier about what i wanted to say here but now i kind of lost it, so. i'll clean this up later, i guess. idk what there is to say about myself... i'm agender and my pronouns are ze/zir (they/them is also acceptable). i like reptiles, blood, horror, pretty anime boys, and being cringe. a famous(?) thing i said once was "basically just think of the phrase 'evil twink' and whatever you just pictured. thats me". uh, i tend to be pretty crass and maybe have a dark sense of humor or smth?</p>
            <p>idk. i'm having second thoughts about even including myself on this page because i'm literally unconscious like almost all of the time these days anyway so like whats the point lmao..... idk.</p>
            <p>that said, i do eventually wanna write a post for this blog about why i kin genocider syo from danganronpa. lmao</p>
            <p>anyway.. vance's/our collective social media and contact links are down below, and i <em>will</em> also see anything sent to vance, in theory (like, i may not be paying attention to the outside world all the time, but we do fully share memories). <em>but,</em> if you ever want to reach out to me in particular, feel free to DM me on <a href="https://plural.cafe/@sooj" rel="noopener noreferrer">mastodon</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/gurolizard" rel="noopener noreferrer">twitter</a>--note that those accounts are 18+, though. if you're under 18 and want to talk to me (which. not sure if i fully recommend but uhhh. shrug), just use one of vance's contact methods below but specify that the message is directed to me.</p>
            <p>i'm also working on <a href="https://gurolizard.neocities.org/">my own site</a> but there's not really anything there yet</p>
