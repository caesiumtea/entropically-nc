The old web was a magical place, but it was also a pretty overwhelming place. Don't get me wrong, I really do love the maximalism of all the flashing blinkies and silly animations all over the place... But for some folks, all that visual noise can be disorienting, nauseating, or even outright dangerous. To me, a really crucial part of the [web revival](https://thoughts.melonking.net/guides/introduction-to-the-web-revival-1-what-is-the-web-revival) is to merge the spirit of the old web with the new knowledge and technological advancements that we've gained in the past 20 years, in order to make a web that truly belongs to *everyone*. And making it belong to everyone means making it accessible to as many people as possible. But does accessibility mean that we need to give up all of those bright shiny GIFs that we love so much?

Fortunately, this is one case where technological improvement can help us make our sites more accessible for more people *and* still keep our silly, flashy traditions alive at the same time. You can actually use JavaScript to swap out animated gifs for a "paused" version, and let the visitor to your site click a button to switch back and forth between the paused and animated versions!
