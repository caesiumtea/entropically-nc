okay, first of all--there's nothing _wrong_ with the neocities editor. it does its job. if it's what you're comfortable with, cool, stick with it! but here are some reasons you might find it beneficial to use an external editor like vscode instead.

note that when i say external editor, i'm referring to ones that are designed specifically for coding or making websites. you could also use a regular text editor like notepad to edit your site locally&#42;, but it wouldn't have all of the benefits that i talk about below.

&#42; "locally" means "on your own computer", as in, _not_ on a server on the internet

## why
### auto-detect errors
this is probably the number one reason to use an editor like vscode. _especially_ if you use any javascript in your website!

i was actually just helping a friend debug their site yesterday, and the whole problem ended up being two missing close curly braces (`}`). the first thing i did when they sent me their code snipper was paste it into vscode (initially just to format it and make it easier to read), but as soon as i did, i immediately got a red squiggly underline telling me that there were unpaired braces! they had spent a bunch of time testing different parts of the code trying to find the error, but i only spent seconds on it, because vscode had checked it automatically and found the problem for me.

### code faster
(autocompletion, emmet)

### git
this is actually a contender for the number one best reason to edit your site outside of the neocities editor. at some point i'll probably write a whole separate post about why i love git, but for now, what you need to know is just that it's a way to track the changes you make to your website.

### neocities goes down sometimes
i mean, not often, but it can happen. (it just happened today before i wrote this, and it's what prompted me to write about this!) and if you were in the middle of editing your website when it goes down, you might lose whatever changes you were in the middle of.

also, you can still work on editing your site even if you don't have an internet connection!
