# vae's blog!!!

this is the code for my blog on [neocities](https://entropically.neocities.org/)!! it's just a place for random little musings and general silliness...

made with [Astro](https://astro.build/)! it's my first time using astro, please give me advice lol

## to do
- fixed "return to top" icon in bottom right
- make the right sidebar sticky ONLY when it holds table of contents
- stop having two duplicate navs, figure out which ur gonna use
- sitemap - maybe not strictly needed just yet, but probably soon
- add comment widget - probably [giscus](https://giscus.app/)? or ayano's?
- fix cursor effect causing page to stretch beyond edges x_x (this will be hard... advice encouraged lol)
- make cute layout graphics (wanna try out image borders!)
- write tutorial about how i made my accessibility menu (toggling fonts and scripts)
- write my general advice/recs for anyone making their first website
- animate settings menu sliding in and out???
- virtual sticker book (inspired by pastelhello.com)
- make submenus or otherwise improve nav/add more pages to nav
  - breadcrumbs
- find a pixel font with tighter spacing tbh
- make tags index into a component instead of duplicating code on blog and tags pages
- convert images to Astro Image component, esp splash page
- custom scrollbars for e.g. changelog
- replace the svg masking on the hamburger menu with something more performant
  - or just ditch the hamburger menu and have nav in the "sidebar" only?
- convert status.cafe widget to feed
